1. Goal: Write an AI solver for the 2048 game.

3. The project was a good showcase of the power of laziness in a functional language.

5. We built our project on top of an existing implementation of a command-line 2048 written in Haskell.
We looked at an existing JavaScript implementation of a solver for 2048 and based our implementation off of that.
We also looked at an analysis of the alpha-beta pruning to conduct more rigorous testing.
